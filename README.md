# Bookstore App

> In this website, I will create an MVP version of Bookstore App that allows:

    * Display a list of books.
    * Add a book.
    * Remove a selected book.:

## for this milestone I followed the following requirements

> In this milestone I used Redux store to display books. also make the UI elements and make them dispatch actions.

* States are immutable.
* Initial state is changed by default value.
* Redux provider is imported to the main component (`index.js`)
* App is connected to Redux store
* List of books are displayed in redux store
* Books are added by using `useDispatch` method
* Books are removed by using `useDispatch` method
* Checkstatus functionality is when button is clicked

> Also I added redux devtools

## Technologies

* React
* SCSS
