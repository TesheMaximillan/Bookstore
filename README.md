# Bookstore App

> In this website, I will create an MVP version of Bookstore App that allows:

    * Display a list of books.
    * Add a book.
    * Remove a selected book.:

## for this milestone I followed the following requirements

> In this milestone I connected React-Redux application to an existing API to create and remove books in a remote server.

* redux-tunk is added to my project as a middleware.
* I used axios for making API calls.
* Redux provider is imported to the main component (`index.js`)
* book lists are loaded from api when the page is reloaded
* addBook and removeBook features are modified to work with the API

## Technologies

* React
* SCSS
